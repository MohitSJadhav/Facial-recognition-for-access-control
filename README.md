# Facial-recognition-for-access-control
Access control is one of the most important counter measures in security for unauthorized access. One of the prominent
reason for the inefficiency in traditional access control methods is that the authentication done on basis of key &amp; lock,
passwords, badges and identity cards is not reliable as these could be forgotten, stolen or tempered. The advancements in
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made face recognition technology more reliable than ever before. This technology has potential
to make access control more secure, reliable, contactless and cost efficient. The reduction in cost and sizes of high resolution
cameras &amp; powerful computing machines are making facial recognition new hotspot for research. We aim to implement system
capable of dynamic video based authentication for making access control efficient and trouble free.
